# Branch-Controller

The branch controllers are running on STM32 Bluepill boards with a wiznet w5500 based ethernet module.

The branch controller depends on the following:
1. Arduino support for STM32F1  ** master? **
2. FastLED with support for STM32F1  ** Currently uses Tenere Branch **
3. Ethernet library, based on the teensy implementation with faster settings  ** master? **


## Arduino settings:
Board:  Generic STM32F103C
Upload Method:  JLink
